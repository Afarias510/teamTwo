      <h1 style="margin: 25px;">What is Raft Wars 2?</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Raft Wars takes place on a beach with Simon and his family. Simon discovers treasure and after it goes on the news pirates, vikings, thugs, japanese warriors, indians, nieghbors, and even his own parents battle out on the seas for the treature, and you have to team up with your brother to defend it. The purpose of the game is to defeat all the bad guys in all 11 levels. You use Simon's brother as the main character (or until he dies, then you use Simon or any other character). There are two ways of defeating your enemy: Keep shooting tennis balls (or any weapon you have) at them until they lose all their HP (two tennis shots in the head usually defeats your opponent and a rocket or missile shot straight at the head kills your opponent) Or getting them to fall into the water (or what from Simon's brother says "sleeping with the fishes").</p>

      <h1 style="margin: 25px;">What makes Raft Wars 2 so Unique?</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">There are numerous of characters in the game and Simon is the only character who was named in the game. Raft Wars was the first Flash Game that involved a mini golf concept. The difference between Mini-Golf and Raft Wars is that children save the day and makes kids feel empowered. Most levels are difficult, so being able to complete makes you feel like a complete boss. Also it has 13 levels, better quality, etc...</p>

      <h1 style="margin: 25px;">What inspired the creator to make this?</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">I don't know tbh, lol.</p>

      <h1 style="margin: 25px;">How many levels does Raft Wars 2 have?</h1>
